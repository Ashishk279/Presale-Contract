# Presale Contract

This project includes a presale contract deployed on the Amoy testnet, utilizing Solidity and OpenZeppelin's ERC20 contracts. Below are the details of the deployed contracts and their respective functionalities.

## Technology Stack
- **Solidity**: The smart contracts were written in Solidity, a high-level, object-oriented programming language for implementing smart contracts.
- **OpenZeppelin ERC20 Contract**: The project utilizes OpenZeppelin's ERC20 standard contract, which provides a solid foundation for creating tokens with basic functionalities like transferring, approving, and querying balances.

## Overview

The Presale contract allows users to participate in the presale event for the CFT token using USDT as the payment currency. It ensures secure and transparent transactions between buyers and the contract.

### Key Features
- **Token Integration**: The presale contract integrates with the CFT and USDT tokens deployed on the Amoy testnet.
- **Secure Transactions**: It leverages OpenZeppelin's well-audited ERC20 contract implementations, ensuring robust security features.
- **Easy Management**: The contract can manage contributions, token distributions, and other presale-related tasks seamlessly.

## How to Interact

1. **CFT Token**: The CFT token contract allows minting and transferring of tokens as part of the presale process.
2. **USDT Token**: Used as the payment method for purchasing CFT tokens during the presale.
3. **Presale Contract**: Handles the actual sale of CFT tokens in exchange for USDT.

### Prerequisites
- A Web3 wallet such as MetaMask connected to the Amoy testnet.
- Sufficient USDT tokens for participation in the presale.

### Steps to Participate
1. Connect your wallet to the Amoy testnet.
2. Visit the Presale contract address on the Amoy Explorer.
3. Interact with the `buyTokens` function to purchase CFT tokens using your USDT balance.
